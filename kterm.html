    <h1>KTerm – Terminal Emulator for Kindle</h1>
    <div class="summary">
      <b>KTerm</b> is a terminal emulator for Kindle e-readers. It allows you to access a command-line interface on your device, using an on-screen virtual keyboard.
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">Why Install KTerm?</div>
    <div class="card card-desc">
      A large number of Kindle modifications, games, and community-developed tools require access to the terminal. Many apps and game ports for jailbroken Kindles use KTerm for installation or operation. If a guide, mod, or game instructs you to "open a terminal" or "run a shell command" on your Kindle, KTerm is almost always the recommended or required tool.<br><br>
      <b>You do not need to be an advanced user or a “tinkerer” to need KTerm.</b><br>
      If you want to use popular Kindle homebrew games, utilities, or tools, you will often need KTerm to complete the setup or to launch the app.
